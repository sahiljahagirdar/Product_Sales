Progress till now:
1. Understod the objective
2. Studied all the columns 
3. Imported the dataset
4. Did basic checks (Head,tail,shape,descibe,info)
5. started with EDA (pending)
6. Checked null values and fixed null values
7. Performed feature Engineering


Upcoming steps:
1. Encode the columns
2. Check if scaling is required
3. Split the data into Train and test
4. Train the models and evaluate the performance
5. Tune the models and check the accuracy score


MODELS TO USE:
- My target column is binary classified:
    1. Logistic Regression
    2. KNN
    3. SVM 
    4. Gradient boost
    5. Random Forest
    6. XG boost
