Progress till now:
1. Understod the objective
2. Studied all the columns 
3. Imported the dataset
4. Did basic checks (Head,tail,shape,descibe,info)
5. started with EDA (pending)
6. Checked null values and fixed null values
7. Performed feature Engineering
8. Encoded the columns 
9. Scaled the required columns 
10. Performed Train and test on the datasets
11. Started training Logistic Regression Model and evaluating model 
12. Started training KNN model and evaluating model


Upcoming steps:
1. Train and tune the models and check the accuracy score


MODELS TO USE:
- My target column is binary classified:
    1. Logistic Regression (In Progress)
    2. KNN (In Progress)
    3. SVM 
    4. Gradient boost
    5. Random Forest
    6. XG boost
